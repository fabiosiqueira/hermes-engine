"""Outbound flood guard for the messaging gateway.

The gateway turns one logical agent reply into as many platform messages as
the payload needs (``BasePlatformAdapter.truncate_message``).  That split was
unbounded and content-blind: a single degenerate model turn — the classic
"repeat one token until the cap" failure mode, seen right after a provider
fallback switch or under rate limiting — was faithfully fanned out into dozens
of consecutive chat messages of pure noise (#118: 41 messages of a repeated
``熊``, 20 of them inside the same minute).

Two independent guards live here, both pure functions so the adapter layer can
call them from any send path:

- :func:`describe_degenerate_repetition` recognises a payload that is a short
  unit repeated to fill the buffer.  The gateway replaces it with ONE visible
  error instead of N messages of garbage — a degenerate loop should surface as
  a failure the operator can act on, not as chat flood.
- :func:`cap_chunk_fanout` bounds how many platform messages one reply may
  become, whatever the content.  The tail is replaced by a visible notice; the
  full text remains in the session transcript.

Both are advisory-by-default-on and tunable through the environment so an
operator who genuinely wants unbounded fan-out can opt out.
